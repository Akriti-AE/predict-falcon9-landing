# predict-falcon9-landing
In this project, I worked on predicting the successful landing of SpaceX Falcon 9 rockets by performing an in-depth analysis of the SpaceX dataset. The project began with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), where I employed Feature Engineering to extract meaningful insights and Interactive Visual Analysis using tools like Folium and Plotly to visualize the data. I applied multiple machine learning algorithms, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), achieving accuracies of 0.84, 0.83, 0.87, and 0.84, respectively. To further enhance the model's performance, I executed Hyperparameter Tuning using GridSearchCV, which resulted in a maximum accuracy of 87% with the Decision Tree model, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting the successful landing of the Falcon 9.
